# Double Pendulum - COMP 342 Mini Project

### [Demo](https://adityathebe.github.io/KU/COMP%20342/Project)

Double pendulum comprising two rigid linkages of negligible mass with point masses attached to the ends of the linkages, confined to two dimensional rotational motion about their joints without any dissipation. Here the double pendulum is initially held at 90 degrees and then released.

The equations used in this simulation is grabbed from [myphysicslab.com](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html)


### Pendulum parameters:
```
g = 9.8 / 3600 
Mass 1 = 1.0kg
Mass 2 = 0.9kg
Link 1 length = 1.0m
Link 2 length = 0.9m
```
