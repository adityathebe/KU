#### 9. Architectures

Architectures that must be analyzed and designed within the context of business objectives and goals
- Data architecture
  provides a framework for the information needs of a bsuiness or business function
- Applications architecture
  encompasses those elements of a system that transform objects within the data architecture for some business purpose
- Technology infrastructure
  provides the foundation for the data and application architectures. The infrastructure encompasses the hardware and software that are used to support the application and data.
