## Virtualization

> Virtualization is the creation and use of an abstraction layer that decouples the physical hardware from the OS to deliver greater resource utilization and flexibility.

> Virtualization is a software technology that makes it possible to run multiple operating systems and applications on the same server at the same time.

**Benefits**
```
- Cost savings because fewer physical servers are required
- Agility : Speed of getting a server up
- Better resource usages
- Lower downtime because a virtual machine can easily be transported to another host
```

### Types of Hardware virtualizations

1. Full virtualization
2. Paravirtualization
3. Emulation virtualization

### Hypervisors

1. **Type 1 / Bare metal**
- Directly installed on top of the physical server
- Low latency
- Most frequently used
- More secure
- Examples : Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, etc

2. **Type 2 / Hosted**
- Installed on top of a host operating system as a software application
- Higher latency
- Less frequently used
- Less secure
- Examples : VMware Workstation, Oracle Virtual box

## Service oriented architectures

SOA represents a model in which functionality is decomposed into distinct units called services, which can be  distributed over a network and can be combined together and reused to create business applications.
