### Definitions

IEEE ( *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers* ) define Software as **"The collection of computer programs, procedures, rules and assosciated documentation and data."**

#### Two types of Software:
Categorized based on - number of developers, size of the software, number of users, compliance to standard development methods) 

1. Simple Software
2. Industrial Strength software systems / programming systems

#### Dual role of software

1. **As a product**:
  It delivers the computing potential of a hardware. Enables the hardware to deliver the expected funtionality.
 
2. **As a vehicle for delivering a product**:
  Helps in creation and control of other programs. Example: Operating System
  
#### What is software Engineering ?
  Software Engineering is the field of computer science that deals with the construction of large, complex and industrial strength software system
  
- *Software Engineering is the systematic approach to the development, maintenance and retirement of the software - IEEE 87'**

- *Software Engineering is the application of science and mathematics by which capabilities of computer equipment are made useful to man via computer programs, procedures and associated documents - Boehm 81'*

- *Software Engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain software that is economical, reliable and works efficiently on real machines - Fritz Bauer*

#### Three key elements(layers) of SWE
1. Methods (*Managerial and technical activities*)
2. Tools (*Automated or semi-automated computer programs*)
3. Procedures (*Combination of methods and tools*)

### Software Problems

- Heterogeneity / Diversity
- Software is expensive
- Late, Costly and Unreliable
- Unreliability ( *Security and Trust* )
- Problem of change and rework

### Software Crisis

### [Fundamental problems of software engineering](http://ecomputernotes.com/software-engineering/what-are-various-software-engineering-problems-explain)

- The problem of scale
- Cost, schedule and quality
- The problem of consistency

### Important qualities of a software product

- Correctness
- Reliability
- Robustness ( *Susceptible to unexpected external changes* )
- User Friendliness
- Verifiability: *Software monitor is used*
- Maintainability
  - Corrective
  - Adaptive
  - Perfective
- Reusability
- Portability
- Modularity: *decomposition, composibility, understanding*
- Testability

### Principles of Software Engineering

1. Make the quality number one objective.
2. High quality software is possible.
3. Give product for customer early (*Quick and dirty prototype*)
4. Determine the problem
5. Evaluate design alternatives
6. Use an appropriate process model
7. Minimize the intellcectural distance between the developer and the user
8. Good management is better than good technology
9. People are the kye to success
10. Follow with care

### Software Applications

- System Software
- Real-time software (*Strict time contstraints*)
- Business software
- Engineering and scientific software (*Number crunching algorithms*)
- Embeded software : *Resides in read-only memory*
- Personal Computer Software
- Artificial Intelligence Software: *Non numerical algorithms*
