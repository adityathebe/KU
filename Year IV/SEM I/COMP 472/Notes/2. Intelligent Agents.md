# 2. Intelligent Agents

## Quick Revision

1. Intelligent Agents
2. Examples of an Agent: Human, Autonomous vehicles, Vacuum cleaner
3. Properties of Agent
    - Autonomous
    - Interaction with other agent and environment
    - Reactive to the environment
    - Proactive
4. Percepts, Percept Sequence, Agent Function `(f: P* --> Actions)`, Agent Program
5. Good Behavior: The Concept Of Rationality
    - Rational Agent, Right thing, Success
    - Rational Agent formal defintion
    - Performance measures ( similar to fitness function in genetic algorithm )
    - Rationality depends on 
        - Performance measure
        - Prior enviroment knowledge
        - Actions
        - Percept sequence to date
6. Task Environments (**PEAS** description)
    - Performance measure
    - Environment
    - Actuators
    - Sensors

**Percept**: An agent's perceptual inputs
**Percept Sequence**: Complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived
Agent's choice of action depends on the entire percept sequence observed to date

## Rational Agent
"*A rational agent is one that does the right thing*"

"*For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.*"

"*Rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome*"

## Performance Measures
Embodies the criterion for success of an agent's behavior

```
It is not easy task to choose the performance measure of an agent.
For example if the performance measure for automated vacuum cleaner is 
“The amount of dirt cleaned within a certain time”
then a rational agent can maximize this performance by cleaning up the dirt, 
then dumping it all on the floor, then cleaning it up again, and so on. 
Therefore “How clean the floor is” is better choice for performance measure of vacuum cleaner.
